# MonopolyOnline
Multiplayer version of the Monopoly game made with Unity 
Made by Tagggy and Zenkeuh.

## Server
A Photon server was used and the appid is not specified in the PhotonSettings, you can simply write it to use your own Photon server.

## Theme
The theme currently applied to the Monopoly board is the Coux one (a small village in Ardeche <3).
You can easily edit the name of each property in Unity and change the albedo of the board surface to get your custom Monopoly.
